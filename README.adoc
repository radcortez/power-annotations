= Power-Annotations

Instead of `SuperHero.class.getAnnotation(Entity.class)`, use `Annotations.on(SuperHero.class).get(Entity.class)` and you'll get some very powerful features described below. This works also for fields and methods; simply use `Annotations.onField` or `Annotations.onMethod`.

== Implemented Features

=== Jandex

If there is a https://github.com/wildfly/jandex[Jandex] index file, all annotations will be read from there. Java reflection will only be used as a fallback if a class is not in the index.

This is purely optional, i.e. if there is no Jandex file, Power-Annotations will fall back to use JDK reflection.


=== Mixins

Say you have a class that you want to but can't add annotations to; maybe it's a class from some library or even from the JDK.
Then you can create your own class (or interface) and annotate it as `@MixinFor` the target class.
The annotations you put on your mixin class will work as if they where on the target class.

Note that the implementation requires a Jandex index file to find the mixins. And of course this works only for the annotations from frameworks that use Power-Annotations.

This also works for annotations: say we're developing an application packed with annotations from JPA, which doesn't support mixins (yet). The application also uses a library that supports mixins but doesn't know about JPA, e.g. a future MP GraphQL. We want all JPA `@Id` annotations to be recognized as synonyms for GraphQL `@Id` annotations. We could create a simple mixin for the JPA annotation:

[source,java]
----
@MixinFor(javax.persistence.Id.class)
@org.eclipse.microprofile.graphql.Id
public class PersistenceIdMixin {}
----

Voila! MP GraphQL would work as if all JPA `@Id` annotations where it's own.


=== Stereotypes

Just like https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/2.0/cdi-spec-2.0.html#stereotypes[CDI-Stereotypes], but not restricted to CDI, i.e. the annotations used by any framework that supports Power Annotations can be used with stereotypes. We have our own `Stereotype` class, but as that would exclude CDI, any annotation with that name will work.

The simplest use-case for Stereotypes is aliasing, i.e. using one annotation instead of another, e.g. `@Property` instead of `@JsonbProperty` (assuming your JBON-B implementation supported Power Annotations). And it gets more interesting, when you add more annotations from other (supporting) frameworks to your stereotype, e.g. `@XmlAttribute` from JAX-B.
