= Power-Annotations

Instead of `SuperHero.class.getAnnotation(Entity.class)`, use `Annotations.on(SuperHero.class).get(Entity.class)` and you'll get some very powerful features:

== Implemented Features

* If there is a https://github.com/wildfly/jandex[Jandex] index file, the annotations will be read from there.

== Planned Features

* Stereotypes (incl. property propagation)
* Mixins (requires Jandex to find the mixins)
* class annotations as fallback for method/field
* package annotations as fallback for classes
* MP Config to overwrite annotations
