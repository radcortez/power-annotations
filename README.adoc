= Power-Annotations

Instead of `SuperHero.class.getAnnotation(Entity.class)`, use `Annotations.on(SuperHero.class).get(Entity.class)` and you'll get some very powerful features described below. This works also for fields and methods; simply use `Annotations.onField` or `Annotations.onMethod`.

== Implemented Features

=== Jandex

If there is a https://github.com/wildfly/jandex[Jandex] index file, all annotations will be read from there. Java reflection will only be used as a fallback if a class is not in the index.


== Planned Features

* Stereotypes (incl. property propagation)
* Mixins (requires Jandex to find the mixins)
* class annotations as fallback for method/field
* package annotations as fallback for classes
* MP Config to overwrite annotations
